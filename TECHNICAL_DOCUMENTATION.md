## 1. System Analysis and Problem Identification {#system-analysis}

### 1.1 Original System Assessment

The initial analysis of the eCyber repository revealed multiple critical issues that prevented the system from being production-ready or competitive in the cybersecurity market. These issues were systematically categorized and prioritized based on their impact on system functionality, security, and user experience.

#### Backend Issues Identified

The FastAPI backend suffered from several fundamental problems that compromised both functionality and security. The authentication system was particularly problematic, with hardcoded credentials, improper JWT implementation, and lack of proper error handling. The OAuth2 configuration was incomplete, with missing token URLs and improper security schemes that would have prevented successful authentication in production environments.

Server stability was another major concern, with the main application lacking proper async context management, inadequate error handling, and no graceful shutdown procedures. The database connections were not properly managed, leading to potential connection leaks and resource exhaustion under load. The packet sniffer service, a core component of the threat detection system, lacked proper error recovery mechanisms and could crash the entire system if network interfaces became unavailable.

Performance optimization was virtually non-existent in the original implementation. There was no caching strategy, database queries were not optimized, and the system lacked proper connection pooling. The multiprocessing implementation was basic and did not include proper resource management or load balancing capabilities.

#### Frontend Issues Identified

The React TypeScript frontend exhibited numerous issues that would have severely impacted user experience and system reliability. The authentication context was poorly implemented, with inadequate error handling and no proper token refresh mechanisms. This would have led to frequent authentication failures and poor user experience.

The API client lacked proper error handling, retry logic, and request/response interceptors. Network failures or temporary service unavailability would have resulted in application crashes or unresponsive interfaces. The WebSocket implementation for real-time updates was fragile and did not include proper reconnection logic or error recovery.

State management throughout the application was inconsistent, with some components using local state while others relied on context providers. This inconsistency would have led to synchronization issues and unpredictable behavior as the application scaled.

#### Electron Application Issues

The Electron desktop application suffered from security vulnerabilities and poor integration with the backend services. The main process lacked proper security configurations, potentially exposing the application to various attack vectors. The preload script was minimal and did not provide adequate isolation between the main process and renderer processes.

Backend service management within the Electron application was problematic, with no proper lifecycle management or error recovery. The application could not reliably start, stop, or restart backend services, which would have severely impacted the desktop user experience.

### 1.2 Security Vulnerabilities Assessment

A comprehensive security assessment revealed multiple vulnerabilities that could have been exploited by malicious actors. These vulnerabilities ranged from basic authentication flaws to more sophisticated attack vectors that could compromise the entire system.

The authentication system used weak JWT secrets and lacked proper token validation. Password hashing was implemented but used default configurations that could be vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. There was no rate limiting, making the system susceptible to brute force attacks and denial of service attempts.

Input validation was minimal throughout the application, creating opportunities for injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other input-based vulnerabilities. The API endpoints lacked proper authorization checks, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive security data.

Data encryption was not implemented for sensitive information stored in the database, and there were no audit logging mechanisms to track security-relevant events. These omissions would have made it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents.

        self.algorithm = algorithm
        self.token_expire_minutes = 1440  # 24 hours
        
    def create_access_token(self, data: dict, expires_delta: Optional[timedelta] = None):
        to_encode = data.copy()
        if expires_delta:
            expire = datetime.utcnow() + expires_delta
        else:
            expire = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=self.token_expire_minutes)
        
        to_encode.update({"exp": expire, "iat": datetime.utcnow()})
        encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, self.secret_key, algorithm=self.algorithm)
        return encoded_jwt
